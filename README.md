### Body

#### Materials

#### Assembly Procedures

### Speakers

#### Materials

Arduino 
DFPlayer Mini 
1W 8 Ohm speaker 
680 Ohm resistor 
1K Ohm resistor 
9V battery 
8705 Voltage Regulator 

#### Assembly Procedures

The Speaker assembly consisted of multiple interconnected pieces. The wiring can be found in Figure X. First, the Arduino was connected to the RX and TX pins of the DFPlayer mini. The RX of the player was connected through a parallel circuit that had two paths starting from the Arduino digital pin. The first path ran through a 680 resistor then split to the player. The second path after running through the 680 resistor, ran through a 1K resistor and to ground. This allowed the Arduino to control when the player functioned. The player controlled the sound, sourcing it to a 1W speaker to amplify the sound. The speaker connected to the SPK1 and SPK2 pins in the player. To power the speaker, a 9V battery was wired as the power source. The battery ran through a voltage regulator to set 5V and 1.5A to the DFPlayer. The voltage regulator output pin connected to the Vin of the player, supplying the necessary power to run the speaker. 

The Arduino IDE code used a downloadable DFPlayer library. After a few set up functions, the DFPlayer Mini could play a specific file from the command “MP3player.play(#)” where # corresponds to the desired sound file number. Sound functions within the system at three separate points. The player functions from the second Arduino. First, an engine sound plays resulting from changes in acceleration. The DFPlayer command was integrated into an if statement for when the accelerometer reads a value above a threshold. The other two sounds, the UK fight song and the reverse sound, function in the same way—however the logic set to run them are found on the first Arduino. The Arduino 1 code sends a signal to Arduino 2 when a specific button is pressed for the fight song and the car is reversing for the reversing sound. Each sound plays through the audio file. The full code can be found in Results.

### Lights

#### Materials

LED x2 
1K Ohm resistor x2 

#### Assembly Procedures

Two LEDs were added to the car in the same way. The circuit for these LED’s are simple and direct, with few components. Fed power from the Arduino, the circuit path flows from a digital pin to the 1K resistor in the breadboard, to the LED, to ground. The LED’s did not share a digital pin, as to allow them to be controlled separately. For the circuit diagram, see Figure X.

### Bluetooth

### Distance Sensing

### Steering
To create a more realistically functioning car, we decided to model the steering after a two-wheel bell crank. The bell crank method uses a two-link system connected to each wheel that allows both wheels to turn from a single servo, similar to actual automobiles. This is done through a series of steering components, which includes a pitman arm, steering knuckles, and drag links. The goal with this system was to create what is known as Ackermann geometry. A steering system is considered to be Ackermann steering if the inside wheel is at a sharper angle than the outside wheel while turning. This is the case with the bell crank system, as seen below.

Figure X: Ackermann Steering Angle Phenomenon

With the pitman arm at a center-point, equal length drag links, and mirrored geometry for the steering knuckles, this creates a sharper angle for the side that the servo is turning away from. If not for this phenomenon, the inside wheel would be fighting the ground during turns due to travelling on a smaller turning radii than the outside wheel, as shown below. Ackermann steering allows for less wear on tires, steering components, and axle gearing if applicable.

### Sound

The car contains a sound component that functions as a final output for multiple logic systems. The sound for the car functions through a DFPlayer Mini. The DFPlayer is an MP3 module for the Arduino. The DFPlayer Mini was chosen as the sound playing device because of its easy integration with the Arduino system. Arduino IDE has a downloadable library for the DFplayer that allows audio to be integrated into the code with a few simple commands. For this application, the DFPlayer Mini connects to a 1W speaker that projects the sound. Housing a micro-SD card, the player runs MP3 audio files when directed by the Arduino microcontroller.  A voltage regulator and 9V battery were used to ensure the system received adequate power. The 9V supplied the voltage, and the regulator ensured adequate current flowed through the DFPlayer and to the speaker.  

### Lights

Lights were an added design feature of the car. These lights were to signal as the car turned. LED’s were chosen because they are often used in Arduino projects, and the bright colors add an additional sensory element for users. Individual LED’s were chosen over a strip of lights due to the high demand for current needed to sustain brightness in a longer string of LED’s. The entire car already had 9V batteries and 5V power packs, so it was determined unnecessary to add additional power sources for just the lights. Additionally, the singular LED’s mimicked the turn signals of a car, fitting well with the theme for the project. 

## Testing Procedures


The steering system also proposed a few challenges. The code was simple, just a few lines taken from online sources and tailored to the needs of this project. The CAD modeling resulted in relatively smooth implementation of the moving parts. However, the first iteration of the steering knuckles did not have clearance for the “lug nuts” and required more drop to allow for them. Connection methods for the drag links were also a point of testing. The holes were too small to reasonably use bolts and screws would’ve inhibited the rotation during turning. 
## Results

## Discussion

Throughout the project, there were multiple challenges and complications that needed to be overcome to complete the deliverables. These challenges molded the final project into what is presented in this report. The WildCar completed each deliverable it set out to do: two-wheel drive, two-wheel steering, wireless Bluetooth control, Lights synced to turning, revving sound from acceleration, beeping upon reversing, playing a song from a controlled input, and stop when too close to an object-- all integrated into a covered complete car design. 

Bluetooth control of the car proved to be both one of the most prominent features and drawbacks of the car. Proving difficult to set up and maintain manually, Bluetooth through a Raspberry Pi was an effective means of remote communication when connected. The system communicated with little delay and the signal transmitted without error. Bluetooth as incorporated in this system, however, had many drawbacks that would limit how well the project could be extrapolated to other projects. First, the connection needed to be manually established. The connection would often get lost, and the connection process repeated. Additionally, using the Pi as a relay from the controller and communicator to the Arduino proved to be an added layer of complexity. Navigating the Pi system was not user friendly and minimally added to the effectiveness of the project. While it did increase the range of connection when compared to the controller and Arduino alone, it was still limited by the inherent limitations of Bluetooth (about 30ft). Higher quality controllers or radio controllers are available for purchase that have greater range, and can cut out the Pi as an intermediate, effectively communicating directly with the Arduino. 

Another limitation with the WildCar design is in regard to power. The Ardunos are only capable of 5V power output with a power pack. Many parts of the design required greater power to run sufficiently when integrated. The final design required two 5V power packs and two 9V batteries. The design was limited by these sources because the batteries would quickly drain and require replacement. The power sources, whilst rechargeable, faced similar issues. The system did supply power effectively, and each component functioned properly with the power supplied. Multiple sources also allowed for each component to receive the specific power needed independently. Performance would decrease as the power drained. A higher quality single power supply would allow for a more integrated design, would last longer, and clean up the wiring. As seen in the use of a voltage regulator to meet the specific needs of the speaker, power output could be modified as needed to meet individual needs of components. A better power supply would also allow the car to run longer at full performance.  

The code for the steering system worked as expected with the lines given online. Integration was easy, as the controller was already connected via Bluetooth to send input to the servo. Another easy fix came through the implementation of cotter pins for the linkage connections; the pins are small enough and allow for rotation during turning. The last step was to add clearance for the lug nuts, which was done through a second iteration of 3D printed steering knuckles. This allowed for tightening of the entire steering system, and brought the car closer to having true Ackermann steering geometry.
